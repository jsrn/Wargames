	-- External Research --
	For this exercise I want you to go online and find out all of the printf 
	escape codes and format sequences. Escape codes are \n or \t that let you 
	print a newline or tab (respectively). Format sequences are the %s or %d 
	that let you print a string or a integer. Find all of the ones available, 
	how you can modify them, and what kind of "precisions" and widths you can 
	do.
